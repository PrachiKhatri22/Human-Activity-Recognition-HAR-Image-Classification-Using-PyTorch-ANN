# Human-Activity-Recognition-HAR-Image-Classification-Using-PyTorch-ANN

##Overview
This project is aimed at classifying images into three categories: Catch, Clap, and Hammering. The model is built using a neural network (NN) classifier with early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with transformations applied to resize images to 64x64 pixels and convert them to tensors. The model is trained using a cross-entropy loss function and an SGD optimizer.
